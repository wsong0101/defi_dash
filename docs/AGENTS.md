# PRINCIPLES

- The codebase should be focused, clean, and easy to understand. Avoid emojis and other non-essential characters.
- DO NOT create a new document. Purge unnecessary code and files.
- Only use UV to install dependencies and run the python application.
- Single Source of Truth: DO NOT place many variables in .env file. Place them in the code instead.
- Run and Debug yourself PROACTIVELY.
- Automated tests are currently disabled; do not create or run test files unless explicitly reinstated.
- For design-related requests, consult the relevant `SKILL.md` before proceeding.
